                    The goal of the points race is to use the crucible of competition to improve our
                    New Mexico Precision Rifle shootersâ€™ skills and prepare them to attend bigger
                    regional and national matches. At the same time, doing this brings together
                    like-minded individuals to grow our sport, our club, and a sense of fellowship.

                    Rancho), and The Zia Rifle And Pistol Club (Albuquerque). Entry into the Series
                    is $60 and may be entered at any time. A look-back entry will be permitted, but
                    only the previous match will count for points. 100% of this money will be
                    returned to the shooters through, Cash payouts, a prize table, a swag bag, and a
                    finale banquet!!! The Series points will be based on both the shooter's overall
                    score and the number of competitors beaten.

                    The first part of the score will be the percentage of the high member's score.
                    (The shooter's score is divided by the high score of all the member shooters.)
                    The second half will be 3 points for every shooter the competitor beats. This
                    will include both Non-Bolt Gun Nation Competitors attending the match and ALL
