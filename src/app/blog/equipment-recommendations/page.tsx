              <p className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">New to precision rifle competitions? Here's everything you need to get started with Bolt Gun Nation matches.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">The good news is that you don't need specialized or expensive equipment to begin competing. Any rifle capable of consistently grouping within one inch at 100 yards will be sufficient for your first matches.</p>
              <p>While heavier rifles and smaller calibers can provide competitive advantages, we strongly encourage new shooters to use their existing equipment if it meets the minimum requirements. Your initial matches should focus on learning the fundamentals, finding targets, and understanding match procedures rather than optimizing gear.</p>
